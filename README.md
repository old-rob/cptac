# Easy access to CPTAC data
This software provides easy access to cancer data from the National Cancer Institute's CPTAC program, which characterizes and studies the proteogenomic landscape of tumors.

This is the old-rob fork which I am using to figure out testing and CI without messing up the real deal. For more information visit [the actual project](https://github.com/PayneLab/cptac)
